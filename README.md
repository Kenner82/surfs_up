# Surfs Up

## Overview of Project
Temperature trends in Oahu were analyzed to determine the financial feasibility of opening a surf and ice cream shop. Data from multiple weather stations across many years was used to compare the average temperature statistics in June and December in order to see if the store could operate year-round.
