# Surfs Up

## Overview of Project
Temperature trends in Oahu were analyzed to determine the financial feasibility of opening a surf and ice cream shop. Data from multiple weather stations across many years was used to compare the average temperature statistics in June and December in order to see if the store could operate year-round.

## Results

* The average temperature in December is only 3 degrees lower than in June (71 vs 74). 
* The max temperature in June is only 2 degrees higher than in December (85 vs 83).
* The greatest temperature differences are in regard to the minimum temperatures, which are still only 8 degrees lower in December than June (56 vs 64).

## Summary
Temperature data across June and December are remarkably similar, suggesting that the weather is mild across both winter and summer and would likely be conducive to both surfing and selling ice cream throughout the year.

What the current data doesn't reflect, however, are the weather conditions that might affect ice cream sales. Though the temperature might stay the same across the year, the demand for ice cream would likely be higher on a sunny day than a rainy day (even if it was a warm rainy day). Analysis of the weather descriptions in June and December would provide useful information on how profitable an ice cream shop would be year round.

Another missing component of the analysis is the impact of the weather on surfing conditions over the course of the year. Too much wind during a thunderstorm might lead to ill-formed waves, but too little wind during a sunny day might lead to a flat ocean. Investigating the wind conditions that lead to the most desireable surf, and then comparing that data to wind data from June and December, would help determine the demand for surfing equipment over the course of the year.
